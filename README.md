Inside the design of a tactic system
====================================

Arnaud Spiwack

Abstract
--------

In this article, I started reflecting on my experience designing and
implementing a new tactic engine for the Coq proof
assistant. Unfortunately I have not finished it and other things took
priority. I'm making it available as is hoping it may still contain
some useful thoughts.
